# Resolution Based Inference Engine
- Implement a resolution function resolving two sentences that are already in conjunctive normal form (CNF).
- Reuse it to implement a complete resolution inference engine accepting conjunctive normal form (CNF) sentences.<br><br>

The resolution inference engine provides three functions
- TELL: add a sentence to the knowledge base.<br>
- ASK: query a proposition is true or false.<br>
- CLEAR: clean the knowedge base.<br>
